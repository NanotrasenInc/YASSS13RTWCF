# YASSS13RTWCF

AKA: Yet Another Shitty SS13 Remake That Will Certainly Fail. It is just what it says on the tin.

# Features

- None at all!

# Requirements

- Requires [the Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/downloads.html) if you intend to compile the project yourself. 

# Usage

- Download the latest version from the release page (none yet), or compile it yourself.
- Run the executables in `target/debug/`

# Building YASSS13RTWCF

As you most probably know, we use Rust as our main framework language and Lua for our embedded language.
After downloading the source code, all you need to do is install Rust and run the following command:

`cargo build`

This will compile the executable which you can subsequently run. Have fun!
